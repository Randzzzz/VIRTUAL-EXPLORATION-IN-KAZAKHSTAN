            Kazakhstan, the world’s largest landlocked country and the
            ninth-largest overall, spans approximately 2,724,900 square
            kilometers. Located in Central Asia, with a small portion extending
            into Eastern Europe, Kazakhstan shares borders with Russia to the
            north, China to the east, and Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and
            Turkmenistan to the south. To the west, the country meets the
            Caspian Sea, the world’s largest inland body of water. This vast
            expanse of land showcases an incredible diversity of landscapes,
            ranging from sweeping steppes and deserts to towering mountains and
            large lakes.
          </p>
          <p class="font-semibold text-xl text-justify mt-4">
            The country experiences a continental climate, characterized by
            harsh winters and hot summers, with temperatures ranging from −40°C
            in the north to 40°C in the south. Rainfall is generally low, making
            much of Kazakhstan dry and semi-arid. Despite this, the fertile
            northern steppes support large-scale wheat production, and the
            country is rich in oil, gas, coal, and uranium, making it an
            economic powerhouse in Central Asia. Positioned strategically
            between Europe and Asia, Kazakhstan plays a vital role in global
            trade, particularly along the modern Silk Road.

          Kazakhstan, boasts a vast and diverse landscape shaped by its
          continental climate and geographical features. Its terrain is
          dominated by a mix of deserts, semi-deserts, steppes, and forests,
          each contributing to the country's unique natural beauty. Deserts
          cover 26% of the land, while semi-deserts extend over 44%, followed by
          6% forested areas and 24% steppe terrain. In addition to these primary
          landscapes, Kazakhstan also features mountains, rivers, and lakes that
          add to its rich ecological diversity.

              Kazakh as the state language of Kazakhstan and Russian as an
              official language used in government and business. Kazakh, a
              Turkic language, is spoken by approximately 80% of the population
              and is written in the Cyrillic script, though the government has
              planned a transition to the Latin alphabet by 2025 to modernize
              and integrate with global communication systems. Russian, spoken
              by over 83% of the population, remains widely used in
              administration, education, and daily interactions, especially in
              urban areas.
            </p>
            <p class="font-semibold text-xl text-justify mt-4">
              Besides Kazakh and Russian, Kazakhstan is home to a linguistically
              diverse population, including speakers of Uzbek, Ukrainian,
              Uyghur, Tatar, and German due to the country's rich ethnic mix. In
              recent years, English has gained popularity, particularly among
              the younger generation and professionals, as Kazakhstan
              strengthens its global connections. The government promotes
              trilingual education (Kazakh, Russian, and English) to enhance
              international opportunities for its citizens.
